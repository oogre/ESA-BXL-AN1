00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.330
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.540
Mimas is one of Saturn's cutest moons.

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:10.650
Its entire surface area is about the
same as

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.799
Spain but its giant crater makes it look like the

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.619
Death Star. And when NASA made a temperature map

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.869
of Mimas, they found that the warmest
regions, shown here in yellow,

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.279
resemble Pac-Man eating the crater

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.519
like a dot. I learned about Mimas whilst

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.940
surfing the world wide web like a true internaut.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.960
But the Web and the

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.899
Internet are different things. The World
Wide Web

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.329
and the Internet have names that are
similar shapes but they

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.879
catch different things. And, as we will see,

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.270
surfing the world wide web is radical

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.690
but it's also apropos. Metaphorically speaking

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.510
the web is pretty wet.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.879
Before the web existed, and before the Internet existed,

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.089
there were computers but they were big

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.260
and lonely. They couldn't really talk to one another.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.100
I mean, sure, you could connect similar
pieces of hardware that spoke similar

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.880
protocols but that was just

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.439
a network. To connect disparate global machines

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.070
you would need a network of networks.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.460
And in the 1960s a bunch of
brilliant minds collaborated on just

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.600
such a thing. Now, at the time, the phone
companies weren't very interested

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.439
and because no single institution could
foot the entire responsibility

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.040
and computing power needed for dedicated lines... Well,

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.530
more innovative and efficient methods were used.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.740
A system spanning many nations is international.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.780
So, a system spanning many networks

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.979
is an Internetwork. It wouldn't be until 1974,

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.000
in this very document, that the word Internetwork

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.869
would be officially shortened to what we
use today - Internet.

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.450
On October 29th, 1969,

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.580
exactly 100 days after we first

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.730
landed on a distant rock across space,

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.739
we first landed a letter on a

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:20.230
distant screen across the Internet.
Leonard Kleinrock and a team at UCLA

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.930
decided to send the word

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.459
'login' to a different model of computer at Stanford.

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.779
They sent the 'L' and it arrived. They sent the 'O'

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.600
and it arrived. And then the system crashed.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.400
But still, the first message sent over an Internet

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.120
was a big deal. On a list of
technological achievements it would rank

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.300
quite high, even though it was literally

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.400
lo... Fast-forward

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.110
two decades. CERN is working on a lot of
different projects with different people

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.110
and technologies

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.110
to figure out who or what is doing what...

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.379
You can just look it up on the Internet.
But the way information was organized on the internet

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:06.129
was illogical. Based on hierarchies, 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:10.159
linearly, it was lame. And this annoyed a guy

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.360
named Tim Berners-Lee. You see,  you could follow a
tree for a really long time

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.500
only to reach a person or technology
involved in some other project

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.680
and for information on that you have to
go back to the beginning and start all

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.580
over again.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.129
So, in March of 1989, Tim Berners-Lee

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:29.560
wrote a powerful paper simply titled
"Information management:

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.840
A Proposal." He argued that notes with links,

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.040
like references, between them is far more
useful than a

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.379
fixed hierarchical system. Instead of trees,

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:43.890
Berners-Lee was proposing a web.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.900
Webbed systems that connect documents
in nonlinear ways already existed.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.659
They were called hypertext.
But Tim Berners-Lee

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:57.739
officiated the marriage of hypertext
webs and the Internet

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:03.150
to produce a web that was worldwide.
It was the vast connected logical and

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.860
useful partnership needed to make the
Internet the most quickly adopted

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.959
form of communication in our species' history.

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.120
The Internet connects participants,

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.019
the web connects information.
Specifically

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.250
hypertext documents accessed via the Internet.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.040
You can see the computer Tim Berners-Lee
created the world wide web with

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.860
in the London Science Museum.
Twenty-five years ago

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.740
if you had unplugged this computer you
would have literally shut down

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.280
the entire web. The first website

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.810
was info.cern.ch. Today it
provides a simulator that allows you to

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.009
view the web

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:48.160
as it appeared as a baby. We've come

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.810
a long way since this.
If you really want your mind blown,

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.389
check out Onesecond[.designly.com] on the web.
You can see how many

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:00.280
Facebook likes, Tweets and even e-mails
are sent every second

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.050
and how many have been sent since you
first opened the page.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.740
Isaac Asimov once said that Earth should
have been named

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.130
ocean because the sea is its dominant

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.509
feature. Our oceans are vast

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:20.180
and dangerous and deep and mysterious.
So, it's no mystery that when people needed

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.410
a metaphor to describe the Internet

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.090
and the seemingly endless and often uncharted

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.199
web of hypertext it delivered, they ran for the sea.

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:33.310
We surf the web, navigating

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.100
streams of data. There are pirates and
floods and phishing.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.820
Even blogs and vlogs have their
linguistic origins

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.560
in logs - records originally kept by
captains at sea.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.200
Like liquid water, the web is a phenomenal solvent.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.090
It makes material widely accessible and available.

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.680
It has been estimated that every web
page is an average

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.910
of only 19 clicks away from every

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.970
other web page. Like our oceans,

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.370
the web is really just one global

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.740
sea. And like our oceans, the web

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.870
is an ecosystem we need to be careful to protect.

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:18.169
It is flexible and flowing, and as we are finding out,

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:23.080
the web, like liquid water, is something
you can see yourself in.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.819
In the 1990s, Douglas Rushkoff coined the term

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:31.050
screenagers to describe a generation
that for the first time ever was growing

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:32.569
up to think that images

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:36.210
on screens weren't just something to passively stare at,

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.880
but, instead, were something to be manipulated.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.970
Well, today it's even more extreme.

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.389
The tools and connectivity, provided by
the Web, allow us to think

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:49.400
of images on screens not just as things to manipulate

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.090
but as things to project our own identities onto.

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.220
Not everyone who does this is a
professional storyteller

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:02.090
or acclaimed poet or coherent.

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:08.360
But, content aside, hyperlinked webs of
human expression are incredibly rich enviroments

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.760
and they exercise the brain, more so than books?

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.840
Well, for the sake of argument,

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:19.590
let's read from "Everything Bad is Good for You,"

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:22.690
a book by Steven Johnson. Now, in this passage

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:26.009
he imagines a world in which books were invented

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:29.479
after video games and the World Wide Web.

00:07:29.479 --> 00:07:32.840
Kids everywhere are starting to read
these new fangled

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.300
books and teachers and parents are
concerned. He imagines

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.530
they might say something like this:

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:43.710
"Perhaps the most dangerous property of these books

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:47.160
is the fact that they follow a fixed linear path.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.680
You can't control their narratives in
any fashion. You simply sit back

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.900
and have the story dictated to you.

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:58.229
For those of us raised on interactive
narratives, this property may seem

00:07:58.229 --> 00:08:01.419
astonishing. Why would anyone want to
embark on an adventure

00:08:01.419 --> 00:08:04.530
utterly choreographed by another
person?

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:07.919
But today's generation embarks on such
adventures

00:08:07.919 --> 00:08:11.410
millions of times a day. Reading is not an

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:15.310
active participatory process, it's a submissive one.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:18.389
The book readers of the younger
generation are learning

00:08:18.389 --> 00:08:22.610
to follow the plot instead of learning to lead."

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:25.759
Interesting. But you might be thinking, come on,

00:08:25.759 --> 00:08:29.080
Michael, you can't set content aside that easily.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.640
What about all the dumb and superficial
stuff the web propagates?

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:37.099
I mean, surely a lot of it is just completely
useless. We're humans, after all, we should

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:42.019
be valuing reason. Maybe.

00:08:42.019 --> 00:08:46.279
But is that really what makes us special?
As Unamuno said,

00:08:46.279 --> 00:08:49.490
"more often I have seen a cat reason

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:52.750
than laugh or weep. Perhaps it weeps or laughs

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:57.649
inwardly. But then perhaps, also inwardly,
a crab resolves equations

00:08:57.649 --> 00:09:03.410
of the second degree." What if cheap
laughs and sappy poems and gossip and

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:06.029
whining and drama and selfies really are

00:09:06.029 --> 00:09:10.790
the most human thing the web has allowed us to do?

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:14.760
That's deep. But not as deep as the Deep Web,

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.220
the hidden web. The part of the web invisible

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:23.380
to search engines. Now, most of this stuff
is innocuous content hidden behind pay

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:25.220
walls or password protection

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:28.980
or dynamically created web pages. But we haven't

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:33.000
even indexed this stuff.
And it's not 1% of the web,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.350
it's not 10%. It's 80%

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:39.459
of the entire World Wide Web.

00:09:39.459 --> 00:09:42.709
The web is a deep ocean

00:09:42.709 --> 00:09:46.940
and we are frantically making waves in it.
For instance, take a look at real time

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:51.940
emoji usage on Twitter and say a few
words of encouragement to be

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:56.519
least popular emoji.
We are also exploring the web

00:09:56.519 --> 00:10:00.690
frantically. It's an entirely new
frontier. Every single day

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:04.399
Google receives 500 million search queries

00:10:04.399 --> 00:10:08.670
it has never been asked before.

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:12.279
Where will all of this exploration lead?

00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:17.620
Who knows? But to go back to our metaphor,
the very same suits we built to explore

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.600
the depths of the ocean

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.910
inspired and enabled the suits we would later use

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:27.209
to go beyond Earth. So, keep exploring,

00:10:27.209 --> 00:10:28.489
keep surfing.

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:29.540
And as always,

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:31.200
thanks for watching.
